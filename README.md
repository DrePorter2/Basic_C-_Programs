# Basic_CSharp_Programs
## This repository contains the C# projects I created during my time with The Tech Academy.

#### My personal favorite here is the CarInsurance3 project, it an MVC web application that takes user's input on their information and calculates a quote based on business logic and display it on the created admin page.
